Ths folder contains the scripts for the aircraft landing optimization project.

The main folder is divided in three sub-folders:
-Simulation_new
-Full unconstrained final
-Constrained

####################
## Simulation_new ##
####################

This sub-folder contains the scripts to perform analysis on how the switching model for the landing procedure behaves.
To use it simply open the script named fly_ground_simulation.m in MATLAB and run it.

##############################
## Full unconstrained final ##
##############################

The scripts in this sub-folder produce the results for the unconstrained version of the optimization problem.
To use it, simply run the script named Full_unc_main.m

#################
## Constrained ##
#################

This sub-folder contains the scripts producing the final results deriving from the constrained optimizaton problem.
To run the complete simulation just open the script named final_main.m in MATLAB and run it.
You may also want to run separate simulations for the ground phase and the flight phase; this is possible by running the scripts
new_main_gr.m and new_main_fl.m respectively.
